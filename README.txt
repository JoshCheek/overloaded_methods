= overloaded_methods

http://github.com/coreyhaines/overloaded_methods

== DESCRIPTION:

overloaded_methods was inspired by erlang pattern matching. Basically, the idea is that you can specify a method and several code blocks based on aspects of the parameters. Here's an example:

overload_method :even_odd do |m|
  m.when {|number| number % 2 == 0 }.do { :even }
  m.when {|number| number % 2 == 1 }.do { :odd }
end

You can then call even_odd(2) and get :even, even_odd(3) gives you :odd.

the specs have more examples.

Special thanks to Jim Weirich for suggesting some great improvements in the syntax.

There is an alternate syntax with pattern/does
overload_method :even_odd do |m|
  m.pattern {|number| number % 2 == 0 }.does { :even }
  m.pattern {|number| number % 2 == 1 }.does { :odd }
end
However, this syntax may or may not be deprecated in favor of the when/do syntax.

* FIX (list of features or problems)

== SYNOPSIS:

The following is from the specs, just some examples of how to use it.

class WithWhenDo
  include OverloadedMethods
  
  overload_method :even_odd do |m|
    m.when {|number| number % 2 == 0 }.do { :even }
    m.when {|number| number % 2 == 1 }.do { :odd }
  end

  overload_method :hello_world do |m|
    m.when { true }.do {'hello, world'}
  end
  
  overload_method :return_params do |m|
    m.when { |param1, param2| true}.do {|param1, param2| [param1, param2]}
  end
  
  overload_method :two_params_collected do |m|
    m.default { |param1, *params| [param1, params] }
  end
  
  overload_method :number_of_digits do |m|
    m.when {|number| number < 10}.do {1}
    m.when {|number| number< 100}.do {2}
    m.default { 'more than two digits is crazy talk'}
  end
  
  overload_method :default_returns_parameters do |m|
    m.default { |*params| params}
  end
  
end
